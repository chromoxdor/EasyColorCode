# EasyColorCode

This repository is made for testing code highlighting and hinting in ESPeasy.
You can test it by using this link: https://raw.githack.com/chromoxdor/EasyColorCode/main/colorcode.html
Or if you want to build your own ESPeasy with code highlighting already integrated, use this branch of my fork: https://github.com/chromoxdor/ESPEasy/tree/powercolor
